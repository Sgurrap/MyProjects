    <p> The Wiki does not contain specific individuals but instead lists genealogical resources that may list an individual. When searching the Research Wiki, search for the place your ancestor was born, lived, and died. If your ancestor, Robert Palmer Jones was born in Sussex, England, type in Sussex in the search field. The Sussex, England page will contain links to online databases and have Sussex topic pages regarding genealogical records pertaining to Sussex.</p>
